# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

## [9.13.1] — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Auto-register MCP server** — `npm create soleri` now auto-registers the agent in `~/.claude.json` during scaffolding. No manual `soleri install` step needed (#551, #552)

### Changed
- **Scaffold next steps** — removed "Run: soleri install" since registration is automatic
- **Website step 3** — updated to show auto-registration instead of manual install command

## [9.13.0] — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Neutral persona template** — `NEUTRAL_PERSONA` constant with full `PersonaConfig`: professional neutral voice, 6 traits, 4 quirks, 6 opinions, 3 greetings, 3 signoffs. Registered as `neutral-custom` in `PERSONA_TEMPLATES` (#545, #547)
- **README placeholders** — `knowledge/`, `data/`, and `hooks/` directories now ship with README.md explaining purpose and usage

### Changed
- **Wizard simplified** — "Custom" persona option now generates a rich neutral persona file directly instead of asking for a description prompt. No LLM at scaffold time, works fully offline
- **Website updated** — removed fake template picker (Forge, Muse, Atlas, Sage, Compass) from EN getting-started, home, and personas pages. Now shows actual wizard flow
- **Troubleshooting** — added "Cannot write to ~/.soleri" entry with npx cache workaround
- **`create-soleri` dependency** — pinned `@soleri/cli` to `>=9.12.1` to prevent stale npx cache issues
- **Release workflow** — tightened npm publish skip pattern to prevent false "already published" on auth errors

## [9.12.1] — 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **`npm create soleri` on clean machine** — preflight check now creates `~/.soleri` before verifying write permissions, fixing `ENOENT` misreported as permissions error (#541)
- **Worktree branch cleanup** — local-only branches with auto-cleanup of merged `subagent/*` and `worktree-agent-*` branches (#540)
- **reapOrphans test mocks** — aligned with `ReapResult` interface (`{ reaped: string[], alive: string[] }`)
- **Windows CI** — platform-aware process group assertions, `USERPROFILE` env for `os.homedir()`, relaxed vault-scaling perf thresholds
- **E2E facade counts** — updated 22→24 / 20→22 after embedding and dream facades added
- **MCP SDK type conflict** — aligned `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to `^1.28.0` across core, forge, and scaffold template; symlink dedup in CI for `file:` links
- **Skill trigger map** — removed references to non-existent skills, rewrote phrases to match actual trigger keywords
- **Extensions scaffold test timeout** — bumped from 5s to 30s for legacy TypeScript scaffolder

### Changed
- **GitHub Actions** — upgraded `checkout` v4→v6, `setup-node` v4→v6, `upload-artifact` v4→v7, `download-artifact` v4→v8 (Node.js 24 compatible)
- **Dead code cleanup** — removed unused `packages/core/src/embeddings/index.ts` barrel, cleaned `ignoreDependencies` in knip config
- **Markdown formatting** — auto-formatted 10 skill/README files via oxfmt
- **"ship it" trigger** — added to deliver-and-ship skill description

### Documentation
- Prerequisites and Tart testing guide (#539)
- Search architecture deep dive

## [9.12.0] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Embeddings module** — provider-agnostic embedding types, OpenAI provider, batch/incremental pipeline, hybrid FTS5+vector search, vector storage table, facade ops (`embed_status`, `embed_rebuild`, `embed_entry`), runtime feature flag (#embedding series)
- **Dream module** — scheduled vault consolidation with `DreamEngine`, `dream_run`/`dream_status`/`dream_check_gate` ops, auto-trigger on session start, `/dream` skill template, `soleri dream` CLI command
- **Orphan reaping** — process group management, active process killing on timeout, post-dispatch orphan reaping in `orchestrate_execute`, `reapOrphans` via admin facade
- **Orphan skill cleanup** — `syncSkillsToClaudeCode` removes stale skill directories with staging backup, `SyncResult.removed` field (#524)
- **`soleri uninstall --full`** — complete agent removal with `--full` flag and `--target` default fix
- **Vault search source** — surface search result source in vault API
- **`/research-scout` skill** — new forge skill template

### Fixed
- **CLI `dev.ts` ESM crash on Node 25+** — replaced bare `require()`/`require.resolve()` with path construction and dynamic `import()` (#531)
- **Missing dependency declarations** — `better-sqlite3` (>=11.0.0) as optionalDep, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` as required peerDep in `@soleri/core` (#532, #533)
- **`npx @soleri/engine` crash** — resolved by declaring `better-sqlite3` in core dependency tree (#533)
- **Skill confusable pairs** — cross-references added in forge to disambiguate confusable skill pairs
- **Orphan reaper return type** — aligned `admin-ops` and `orchestrate-ops` with `ReapResult`
- **Dream facade registration** — registered in MCP engine module list
- **Test pollution** — vitest include whitelist prevents worktree test bleed; brittle tmpdir and hardcoded op count patterns replaced

### Changed
- **Skills path migration** — install path moved from `~/.claude/commands/` to `~/.claude/skills/`
- **Skills renamed** — all 35 skills prefixed with `soleri-`, deduplicated trigger keywords
- **10 skills upgraded** — enhanced engine ops in partially-wired skills, 4 previously inactive skills fully wired
- **CLAUDE.md slimmed** — bootstrap-only in repo, full docs moved to vault
- **`.claude/` gitignored** — worktree artifacts excluded

## [9.11.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- **User-gated reconciliation with fix-trail learning** — `orchestrate_complete` runs git evidence for all plan outcomes, tracks fix iterations per task (rework detection), records quality signals to brain (clean=accepted 0.9, rework=dismissed 0.7), injects fix-trail summary into session context for knowledge extraction (#459, #460, #461, #462, #463)
- **`--path` flag on agent commands** — `soleri agent status/update/refresh/diff --path <dir>` works from any directory (#503)
- **`orchestrate_status` op** — check plan readiness with terminal task counts and idle duration
- **`buildFixTrailSummary()`** — exported utility for human-readable rework summaries

### Changed
- `evidenceReport` always present in `orchestrate_complete` response (null when unavailable, was previously omitted)
- Rework threshold changed from `> 2` to `>= 2` fix iterations for anti-pattern detection
- Confidence values extracted to named constants (`CLEAN_TASK_CONFIDENCE`, `REWORK_TASK_CONFIDENCE`)
- Removed internal "v7" label from `soleri agent status` output

## [9.10.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Modular CLAUDE.md engine rules** — `engine.features` in agent.yaml controls which rule modules are included (vault, planning, brain, advanced); core always included; default = all for backward compatibility (#488, #491)
- **User:custom preserved zone** — `<!-- user:custom -->` markers in CLAUDE.md survive `soleri dev` regeneration; orphaned content outside markers triggers a warning (#489)
- **RTK hook pack** — LLM token compression via RTK proxy; intercepts Bash commands and rewrites through RTK for 60-90% token reduction
- **SEO optimization for soleri.ai** — compressed OG image (2.6MB → 217KB), BreadcrumbList JSON-LD for 149 doc pages, CollectionPage schema for articles, full favicon set, Twitter/Threads social links, language switcher re-enabled
- **Section parser module** — extracted marker-delimited section parsing from shared-rules.ts into `section-parser.ts` with single-pass regex approach (#496, #497)

### Fixed
- **Global CLAUDE.md bloat** — engine rules no longer injected into `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`; self-healing strips leaked rules during `admin_setup_global` (#490)
- **Vault session export paths** — `findProjectRoot()` walks up to monorepo root; exports no longer land in package subdirectories (#495)
- **RTK hook `stat` compatibility** — `warn_once()` uses conditional guards instead of `||` chain to work under `set -e` on Linux
- **RTK hook output contract** — correct Claude Code `hookSpecificOutput` format with `updatedInput`

### Changed
- **Deduplicated ENGINE_FEATURE_VALUES** — single source of truth in shared-rules.ts, imported by agent-schema.ts (#499)
- **RTK hook warns on missing deps** — stderr warning when `jq` or `rtk` not installed, once per day via flag file (#498)
- `getModularEngineRules()` reduced from 90 lines to 14-line thin wrapper delegating to section-parser

## [9.9.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Temporal decay for brain strength scores** — 90-day exponential halflife with 0.3 floor prevents zombie patterns from dominating recommendations; also fixes pre-existing bug where recency scoring misinterpreted unix epoch timestamps
- **Subagent behavioral contract** — new "Subagent Identity & Behavioral Contract" section in shared-rules with 6 rules: hybrid routing (Claude Code workers vs Soleri agent instances), orchestrator-owns-decisions, no-plan-in-subagent, worktree cleanup guarantee, escalation protocol, UX output contract
- **Subagent dispatch docs** — reference guide and hands-on tutorial in Starlight docs under Deep Dives
- **Curator backfills Zettelkasten links** — curator consolidation now auto-creates links during grooming (#484)
- **Incremental vault markdown sync** — sync on capture instead of batch, reducing I/O (#471)
- **Workflow overrides in orchestrate_plan** — override workflow steps via plan params (#480)
- **Workflow loader module** — load and validate workflow YAML at runtime (#478)
- **Schema comments in scaffold** — gates.yaml and tools.yaml get inline documentation (#481)
- **Cross-platform CI** — testing on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **Comprehensive docs overhaul** — 11 new guides, full accuracy pass across all documentation

### Fixed
- Grade gate chicken-and-egg: grader now downgrades no-tasks gap to major when approach has structured steps, unblocking plan approval
- Windows path normalization in MCP config files
- Node.js version check and preflight permission checks in CLI
- Improved error messages and fix for silent watch failures in dev mode
- Windows-compatible scaffolder tests
- OpenCode adapter test Windows compatibility
- Scaffold git init test CI safety
- Stabilized orchestrate_complete E2E test
- Removed dead WorkflowToolsSchema export

## [9.8.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Workspace-scoped context** — `workspaces/` directory with per-workspace `CONTEXT.md` files, domain seeding for default workspaces (#468)
- **Visible routing table** — task pattern → workspace + context + skills mapping in generated CLAUDE.md
- **Essential skills filter** — scaffold ships 7 skills by default instead of 31; `skillsFilter` in agent.yaml (`'all'` | `'essential'` | `string[]`)
- **User-editable CLAUDE.md** — `instructions/user.md` gets priority placement before engine rules, survives regeneration
- **Example instruction files** — `conventions.md` and `getting-started.md` scaffolded into `instructions/`
- **5 persona starter agents** — Muse (content), Atlas (freelance), Forge (dev), Sage (research), Compass (business) in `examples/`
- **OpenCode adapter** — enforcement and hook integration for OpenCode editors
- **User-gated reconciliation** — fix-trail learning with user approval gate (#459)
- **Git init in scaffold** — `git init` and remote push added to scaffold flow
- **Website: 75/20/5 framework** — new positioning across homepage, how-it-works, your-agent, getting-started pages
- **Website: Map/Rooms/Tools language** — 3-layer architecture naming across all pages

### Fixed
- Git init on `--config` path was silently skipped
- Niche hook packs hidden from scaffold picker
- File-tree agent CLI parity — all commands work without `package.json`
- Multi-line template picker rendering on getting-started page
- Path separator normalization in trust-classifier inventory

## v9.7.2 — 2026-03-28 — Hook Pack Settings Fix

### Bug Fix

- **CLI: lifecycle hook schema** — `addLifecycleHooks()` was writing flat objects to `settings.json` instead of the required `{ matcher, hooks: [...] }` structure, causing Claude Code to reject the settings file on startup. Now correctly wraps hook definitions with matcher and hooks array. Also carries `statusMessage` through to the output.

## v9.7.1 — 2026-03-28 — Update Notification Improvements

### Update Check Enhancements (#443, #445, #446)

- **Session-start update check** — `checkForUpdate()` now fires on every `session_start`, not just engine boot. Fire-and-forget, reuses 24h cache (#443)
- **Changelog URL** — update notifications now include a link to the GitHub release: `https://github.com/adrozdenko/soleri/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z` (#445)
- **Breaking change detection** — major version bumps trigger a warning; minor jumps of 2+ suggest reviewing the changelog (#446)
- New exports: `UpdateInfo`, `buildChangelogUrl`, `detectBreakingChanges` from `@soleri/core`
- 14 unit tests (#447)

### CLI: `soleri pack update` (#444)

- **New command** — `soleri pack update` checks npm registry for outdated packs, displays aligned table, updates to latest
- **`--check` flag** — dry-run mode shows outdated packs without installing
- **Edge cases** — graceful handling for no packs, local packs, unreachable registry
- 8 unit tests

## v9.7.0 — 2026-03-27 — Paperclip Adaptation & Runtime Foundations

### Paperclip Adaptation — 3 Features (#413–#415)

Adapts key patterns from [Paperclip AI](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip) into Soleri, completing the Paperclip Adaptation milestone.

#### Skill Trust Levels & Source Tracking (#413, #416–#423)

Skills now carry provenance metadata — Soleri knows where every skill came from and how dangerous it is.

- **TrustClassifier** — auto-classifies skills on install/sync: `markdown_only` (safe), `assets` (warning), `scripts` (requires approval) (#417)
- **Source tracking** — every skill records its origin: `builtin`, `pack`, `local`, `github`, `npm` (#416)
- **Approval gate** — skills with executable scripts require explicit user approval before installation (#419)
- **Engine version compatibility** — semver check against current Soleri version, returns `compatible`/`unknown`/`invalid` (#420)
- **CLI visibility** — `soleri skills list --trust` shows trust level, source, and compatibility (#421)
- 19 unit tests (#422)

#### Session Compaction Policies (#414, #424–#432)

Configurable session rotation with handoff notes — agents pick up where they left off instead of starting cold.

- **CompactionEvaluator** — checks three thresholds: `maxRuns` (200), `maxInputTokens` (2M), `maxAge` (72h) (#425)
- **Three-level PolicyResolver** — agent.yaml overrides > adapter defaults > engine defaults, individual field merge (#426)
- **HandoffRenderer** — markdown handoff notes with reason, in-progress work, key decisions, files modified (#427)
- **ContextHealthMonitor integration** — evaluator runs on every health check, triggers PreCompact hook (#428)
- **Handoff injection** — persisted on rotation, injected into next session_start (#429)
- **agent.yaml config** — `engine.compactionPolicy` block in agent schema (#430)
- 25 unit tests (#431)

#### Task Ancestry & Goal Context Hierarchy (#415, #433–#441)

Plans and tasks now carry the full chain of WHY — subagents understand the mission, not just the task.

- **Goal type** — `objective` → `project` → `plan` → `task` hierarchy with status tracking (#433)
- **GoalAncestry class** — `getAncestors()` walks parent chain (max 10, cycle detection), `getContext()` renders markdown, `inject()` adds to ExecutionContext (#434)
- **Goal storage** — JSON-backed persistence with CRUD operations (#435)
- **Planner integration** — `create_plan` accepts optional `goalId`, `plan_split` inherits to child tasks (#436, #437)
- **GitHub projection** — projected issues include `## Goal Context` section (#438)
- **Subagent dispatch** — goal ancestry injected into execution context on dispatch (#439)
- 22 unit tests (#440)

### Adapter Abstraction & Subagent Runtime (#402–#412)

Foundation layer for multi-runtime support, landed in v9.6.0 cycle.

- **Adapter abstraction** — strategy pattern for runtime adapters (Claude Code first) (#402)
- **Subagent runtime** — dispatcher, concurrency manager, orphan reaper, result aggregator, workspace resolver (#403–#408)
- **Pack lifecycle** — install/uninstall/update hooks for pack state machines (#409)
- **Orchestrate ops** — runtime orchestration operations for subagent coordination (#410)

### Forge & CLI Improvements

- **CLAUDE.md composition** — slimmed down composed output by ~88% (#323)
- **Engine rules** — added getting started, troubleshooting, and CLAUDE.md composition pipeline knowledge
- **CLI scaffold fix** — scaffold agent in current directory instead of `~/.soleri/`
- **Lazy-load better-sqlite3** — eliminates native dep requirement during scaffolding
- **create-soleri** — include `dist/` in published npm tarball

### CI & Testing

- **lint-staged** — package.json formatting via oxfmt
- **E2E stability** — threads pool for heavy tests, fire-and-forget cleanup to prevent worker timeout
- **Windows** — path fixes and E2E assertion corrections

## v9.5.0 — 2026-03-27 — Performance, Windows Support & Forge Polish

### Performance — 10 Issues Resolved (#385–#394)

Major performance overhaul across `@soleri/core`. All P0 and P1 performance issues from the comprehensive audit are now resolved.

- **SQLite transactions** — `persistVocabulary()` DELETE moved inside transaction, `computeStrengths()` batch-persisted (#385)
- **Missing indexes** — 7 high-frequency column indexes added via `migratePerformanceIndexes()` (#386)
- **WAL mode** — pragmas now applied on both constructor paths (string + injected provider) (#387)
- **Shutdown registry** — `ShutdownRegistry` with LIFO cleanup for timers, watchers, child processes (#388)
- **Timeouts & limits** — `AbortSignal.timeout(60s)` on OpenAI fetch, 120s fallback on Anthropic, 10MB HTTP body limit, 1MB WS buffer limit (#389)
- **Async exec** — 7 `execFileSync` calls replaced with async `execFile` in github-projection, `detectGitHubContext` parallelized with `Promise.all` (#390)
- **Brain lazy-init** — vocabulary loaded from DB at startup, full rebuild only when table empty, incremental persist (#391)
- **O(n^2) → O(n*k)** — duplicate detection now uses content-hash for exact dupes + FTS5 candidate matching for fuzzy (#392)
- **Cached routeIntent** — `getModes()` cached with invalidation, `queryVec` hoisted out of scoring loop (#393)
- **N+1 query fixes** — batch `WHERE IN` for traverse, loadEntries, memoriesByProject, archive; JOIN in computeStrengths (#394)

### Windows Support (#395–#400)

Native Windows support via Git for Windows (Git Bash). No WSL2 required.

- **Cross-platform temp paths** — shell scripts use `${TMPDIR:-${TEMP:-/tmp}}`, TypeScript uses `os.tmpdir()` (#396)
- **Platform guards** — all `chmodSync`/`symlinkSync` calls guarded with `process.platform !== 'win32'` (#397)
- **Windows setup guide** — new docs page covering prerequisites, build tools, hook packs, troubleshooting (#398)
- **CI test matrix** — `windows-latest` runner added for core + CLI unit tests (#399)
- **README updated** — platform line changed from "WSL2 required" to native Windows support (#400)

### Forge Polish (#323, #324)

- **Model routing hints** — guidance table in shared-rules for Opus/Sonnet/Haiku by workflow stage (#324)
- **Handoff documents** — `handoff_generate` op for structured context transitions, `context-handoff` workflow scaffolded into new agents, handoff protocol added to session lifecycle rules (#323)

### Safety Hook Pack (#340)

Anti-deletion hook extracted from `yolo-safety` into standalone `safety` pack, installable via `soleri hooks add-pack safety`. Added 7-day auto-cleanup for staging backups. `yolo-safety` now composes from `safety`. Fixed `getInstalledPacks` to detect composed packs.

### Skill-to-Hook Conversion System (#285-290)

Complete system for converting repeatedly-invoked skills into automated Claude Code hooks.

- **Candidate scorer** — 4-dimension rubric (frequency, event correlation, determinism, autonomy) in `@soleri/core`
- **`soleri hooks convert`** — scaffolds hook pack from CLI args (all 5 hook events, 3 action levels)
- **`soleri hooks test`** — validation framework with 15 fixtures per hook, false positive/negative detection
- **`soleri hooks promote/demote`** — graduated enforcement: remind → warn → block
- **marketing-research** worked example — PreToolUse hook for brand guidelines
- **`actionLevel`** field added to `HookPackManifest`
- 100 unit tests + 18 e2e tests

### Flock-Guard Hook Pack (#371)

Parallel agent lock guard — prevents lockfile corruption when multiple agents run in worktrees.

- **Atomic `mkdir` + JSON state** — POSIX-portable cross-process locking (not flock)
- **PreToolUse** acquires lock, **PostToolUse** releases — spans the operation
- **Stale detection** — 30s timeout prevents deadlocks from crashed agents
- **Reentrant** — same agent can chain multiple install commands
- Protects: `npm install`, `yarn`, `pnpm install`, `cargo build/update`, `pip install`
- 10 unit tests + 9 e2e tests (parallel contention simulation)

## v9.4.0 — 2026-03-26 — YOLO Mode, Op Visibility & Brain Feedback Loop

### YOLO Mode (#343, #347)

Autonomous execution mode — skip plan approval gates while preserving all safety invariants.

- **YOLO Mode wave 1** — 10 tasks executed in parallel with worktree isolation (#343)
- **YOLO Mode wave 2** — activation gate, docs, and skill (#343)
- **`soleri yolo` CLI command** — activate/deactivate YOLO mode from terminal (#347)
- **YOLO Safety Hook Pack** — intercepts destructive commands, requires explicit confirmation

### Op Visibility

Internal ops (tokens, bulk operations, telemetry, automation) are now hidden from MCP tool descriptions but remain callable programmatically.

- **`OpVisibility` type** — `'user' | 'internal'` controls MCP exposure
- **`INTERNAL_OPS` set** — centralized registry of 30+ infrastructure ops
- **Backward compatible** — ops without visibility field default to `'user'`

### Vault Enrichment & Brain Feedback Loop

`create_plan` now auto-searches the vault for patterns matching the objective and injects them as decisions with `[entryId:...]` markers. On plan completion, the brain feedback helper extracts those markers to record feedback — closing the learning loop.

- **`plan-feedback-helper`** — shared helper for extracting entry IDs and recording brain feedback
- **Auto-enrichment** — vault patterns automatically added to plan decisions
- **`vaultEntryIds`** returned from `create_plan` for traceability

### Brain Extraction Rewrite (#358, #361-366)

TDD rewrite of the brain extraction pipeline — smarter pattern detection with context correlation.

- **`plan_completed`** extraction with context parsing (#361)
- **`plan_abandoned`** extraction with failure analysis (#362)
- **`multi_file_edit`** extraction with pattern inference (#363)
- **`repeated_tool`** extraction with context correlation (#364)
- **`drift_detected`** extraction rule (#366)
- **`long_session` removed**, dedup guard added (#358)

### Operator Context Learning (#509)

Signal taxonomy, persistent store, and orchestrate integration for learning operator preferences silently.

- **Signal taxonomy** — expertise, corrections, interests, work patterns
- **Drift-triggered file render** — correction undo detection (#506)
- **Operator context inspection** commands + E2E validation (#723)

### Plan Lifecycle Safety Net (#372)

Auto-close stale plans that linger in `executing` or `reconciling` state.

- **`plan_close_stale` op** — closes plans past TTL
- **`plan_iterate`** rejects unknown keys with strictObject (#341)
- **Scan mode** for `search_intelligent` op (#370)

### Worktree Automation (#357)

- **Automatic worktree cleanup** for scaffolded agents
- **Post-merge hook** prunes stale worktrees after branch merges
- **Vitest exclude** — `.claude/worktrees/**` excluded from all test configs
- **Python setup scripts** for hook registration

### Forge & Skills

- **Persona self-update rules** — guides agents to edit `agent.yaml`, not engine code
- **Brain feedback loop rule** in shared-rules
- **7 new skills** + categorized CLAUDE.md index + skill sync for file-tree agents (#11943f1)
- **Agent-issues skill** + agent name prefix on synced skills
- **Mandatory agent name prefix** on all responses when persona active

### Pack Tier System

- **Default/Community/Premium** tiers for knowledge packs
- **`pack_tier` system** with tier-aware search and validation

### Other Changes

- **Curator duplicate dismissal** — stop re-flagging reviewed pairs
- **`radar_dismiss`** accepts batch IDs
- **Admin health** now reports skills and hooks status
- **Archetype system removed** from CLI
- **MCP SDK bumped** to 1.28.0
- **E2E bulletproof refactor** — 880+ tests across 28 files, 3 bugs fixed
- **Documentation audit** — fixed stale counts, legacy refs, broken links

### CI Fixes

- **Module manifest test** updated for new keyOps (vault, plan, admin)
- **Stale test assertions** fixed after YOLO wave 1
- **Worktree exclusion** prevents duplicate test runs in CI

## v9.3.1 — 2026-03-23 — Persona Overlay Mode & Task Auto-Assessment

### Persona Overlay Mode (#325)

Agents now drive the full cycle through their MCP tools when activated — not Claude with tools on the side.

- **Tool-first routing** — vault search before training data, brain recommend before guessing, planning before coding
- **Self-healing discovery** — agent calls `admin_tool_list` after activation or compaction to refresh capabilities
- **Dynamic intent signals** — all 20 engine modules declare `intentSignals` mapping natural phrases to ops
- **Character persistence** — persona voice survives context compaction (rules live in CLAUDE.md)

### Task Complexity Auto-Assessment (#331)

Agents autonomously decide whether to plan or execute directly — but always capture knowledge.

- **TaskComplexityAssessor** — pure function with 6 weighted signals (file count, cross-cutting, dependencies, design decisions, parent context, multi-domain). Score ≥ 40 → complex, < 40 → simple.
- **Plan-optional `orchestrate_complete`** — works without a preceding plan, still captures vault + session + brain feedback
- **Non-negotiable knowledge trail** — `orchestrate_complete` runs for ALL tasks, simple or complex
- **Routing rules** in shared-rules.ts — assess → route → always complete

### CI Fixes

- Class-based vitest mocks for GH Actions Node 22 ESM compatibility
- Relaxed vault scaling test thresholds for slow CI runners
- knip dead code check non-blocking, CLI test timeout resolved

## v9.3.0 — 2026-03-23 — Vault Facade Split, TDD Completion & Dead Code Cleanup

### Vault Facade Split

The monolithic vault facade (76+ ops) has been decomposed into 8 focused facades. The engine now registers **20 semantic modules** (up from 13).

| New Facade  | Ops | Purpose                                         |
| ----------- | --- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `archive`   | 12  | Archival, lifecycle, knowledge maintenance      |
| `sync`      | 8   | Git, Obsidian, and pack sync                    |
| `review`    | 5   | Knowledge review workflow                       |
| `intake`    | 7   | Content ingestion — books, URLs, text, batch    |
| `links`     | 9   | Entry linking, traversal, orphan detection      |
| `branching` | 5   | Vault branching — create, list, merge, delete   |
| `tier`      | 7   | Multi-vault tiers — connect, disconnect, search |

- **Backward compat** — moved ops still dispatch via vault facade with deprecation warnings
- **`createSemanticFacades()`** updated with all 20 modules
- **E2E tests** updated for new facade count (22 = 20 semantic + 2 domain)

### TDD Refactoring Complete (Waves 1-4 + Post-Cleanup)

All TDD refactoring waves are closed. Every `@soleri/core` module now has colocated tests.

- **184 test files, 3,669 tests, zero failures**
- **`src/__tests__/` directory deleted** — 71 duplicates removed, 20 orphans relocated to colocated locations
- **135 lint errors fixed** across 38 files
- **4 monoliths decomposed:**
  - `planner.ts` 1,556 → 392 LOC (+ plan-lifecycle, task-verifier, reconciliation-engine)
  - `curator.ts` 951 → 287 LOC (+ duplicate-detector, contradiction-detector, tag-manager, health-audit, metadata-enricher)
  - `gap-analysis.ts` 967 → 299 LOC (+ gap-patterns, gap-passes)

## v9.1.1 — 2026-03-21 — Bug Fixes, DX & Second Brain Foundations

### Bug Fixes

- **Persona override fixed** (#260) — `activate` op now consults identity manager; custom identity via `update_identity` is respected instead of reverting to boot-time persona
- **Morph modes documented** (#261) — Error message lists all 10 available modes; `"reset"` added as built-in alias for `GENERAL-MODE`; facade schema updated
- **Governance policy validation** (#262) — `governance_policy` set action validates `policyType` before DB insert instead of leaking SQLite NOT NULL constraint
- **Cross-domain duplicate detection** (#263) — Curator no longer flags entries in different domains as duplicates; same-domain detection unchanged
- **Plan auto-reconcile** (#264) — `complete_plan` auto-calls `reconcile()` when plan is in executing/validating state; updated op description

### Performance

- **Instant engine startup** (#279) — `soleri install` resolves absolute path to engine binary via `require.resolve()`, eliminating `npx` cold-start (~200ms vs 2-5s). Falls back to npx if not locally installed.

### Features

- **Centralized home directory** — All agent data now lives under `~/.soleri/{agent-id}/` with legacy fallback
- **Brain auto-learning pipeline** — Auto-promotes high-confidence proposals (≥0.8), triggers `buildIntelligence()` every 3 plan completions, links brain sessions to plan IDs
- **Automatic vault ingestion** — Brain indexing and Zettelkasten linking on engine startup
- **Skills auto-sync** — Engine startup syncs skills to `~/.claude/commands/` automatically
- **Agent branding in skills** — Skills injected with agent identity on sync
- **17 bundled skills** — New agents ship with curated skill set

### Published Packages

## v9.0.0 — 2026-03-20 — Composable Persona System & Cognee Removal

### Breaking Changes

- **Cognee removed** — `CogneeClient`, `CogneeSyncManager`, and all Cognee-related ops removed from the engine. Vault FTS5 + Brain TF-IDF is the sole search layer. The `engine.cognee` config option is ignored. Remove `COGNEE_BASE_URL` from environment and `docker-compose.cognee.yml` from deployments.
- **`AgentRuntimeConfig.cognee`** field removed. Agents with `cognee: true` in agent.yaml will work but the field is silently ignored.
- **`AgentRuntime.cognee`** and **`AgentRuntime.syncManager`** fields removed from runtime interface.
- **Admin ops** no longer report Cognee status in `admin_health`, `admin_diagnostic`, or `admin_setup_check`.
- **`drain()` / `drainAll()`** removed — no sync queue exists without Cognee.
- **`domains` and `principles` no longer required** in agent.yaml / create wizard. Empty arrays are valid — agents discover their domains from usage.

### Features

- **Composable Persona System** — Agents now have a `persona:` block in agent.yaml that defines character, voice, cultural texture, traits, quirks, opinions, and metaphors. The persona defines HOW the agent communicates, not WHAT it knows.
- **Italian Craftsperson default** — New agents ship with the Italian Craftsperson persona (inspired by Paolo Soleri). Warm, opinionated about quality, sprinkles Italian expressions naturally. Universal — works for any domain.
- **Persona loader** — `loadPersona()` reads persona from agent.yaml, falls back to Italian Craftsperson default. Supports template expansion and user overrides.
- **System prompt generation** — `generatePersonaInstructions()` transforms persona YAML into natural language instructions for the LLM, including voice, traits, quirks, opinions, metaphors, cultural texture, and identity persistence rules.
- **Activate returns persona** — `activate` op now returns full persona config with generated system instructions instead of legacy tone/principles.
- **Persona prompt** — MCP `persona` prompt returns generated persona instructions for client consumption.
- **Simplified create wizard** — `soleri create` now asks 2 questions: name + optional persona description. Removed archetype picker (14 archetypes), domain multiselect, principles multiselect, skills multiselect, and tone picker. 547 lines → 130 lines.
- **Persona templates** — `PERSONA_TEMPLATES` registry allows multiple built-in personas. Currently ships with `italian-craftsperson`.

### Types

- New: `PersonaConfig`, `ArchivedPersona`, `PersonaCreateInput`, `PersonaSystemInstructions`
- New exports: `loadPersona`, `generatePersonaInstructions`, `getRandomSignoff`, `createDefaultPersona`, `ITALIAN_CRAFTSPERSON`, `PERSONA_TEMPLATES`
- `AgentRuntime` now includes `persona: PersonaConfig` and `personaInstructions: PersonaSystemInstructions`
- `AgentRuntimeConfig` now accepts optional `persona?: Partial<PersonaConfig>`
- `AgentYamlSchema` and `AgentConfigSchema`: `domains` and `principles` are now optional (default to `[]`)

### Removed

- `packages/core/src/cognee/` — entire directory
- `CogneeClient`, `CogneeSyncManager`, `CogneeConfig`, `CogneeStatus` types
- `cognee_search`, `cognee_add`, `cognee_cognify`, `cognee_sync_*` ops
- `packages/cli/src/prompts/archetypes.ts` — 14 archetype definitions
- Cognee references from admin ops (`admin_health`, `admin_diagnostic`, `admin_gc`, `admin_setup_check`)

---

## v8.2.0 — 2026-03-19 — Cognee Sync Reliability & Zettelkasten Link Export

### Bug Fixes

- **Auth retry on 401** — `addEntries()` now retries with fresh token when Cognee returns 401 instead of silently returning `{ added: 0 }`. Fixes JWT expiry causing entire sync queue to fail. (#243)
- **Health cache stale-lock** — `drain()` refreshes the health cache before checking availability. Previously, drains after the 60s TTL silently returned 0. (#243)
- **Structured drain errors** — `drain()` returns `DrainResult` with `reason` field (`cognee_unavailable`, `auth_failed`, `queue_empty`, `partial_failure`) instead of bare `0`. MCP responses include actionable `hint` per failure code. (#243)
- **Auth error propagation** — `ensureAuth()` failures now surface as `{ code: 'AUTH_FAILED', error: '...' }` instead of being swallowed by `.catch(() => null)`. (#243)

### Features

- **`drainAll()` method** — Loops drain until queue empty with progress callback, `AbortSignal` cancellation, and `forceCognify` option. Exposed as `cognee_sync_drain_all` MCP op. Eliminates need for rapid-fire external drain calls. (#243)
- **Configurable batch size** — `SyncManagerConfig` with `batchSize` (default 50) and `maxRetries` (default 3). Agents with large vaults can tune throughput.
- **`forceCognify` parameter** — Both `drain()` and `drainAll()` accept `forceCognify` to trigger graph building immediately instead of relying on the 30s debounce timer.
- **`ensureHealthy()` on CogneeClient** — Refreshes stale health cache and returns current status in one call.
- **Zettelkasten link export** — `IntelligenceBundle` now includes optional `links` array. `vault_export_pack` exports links where both endpoints are in the export set. `vault_import_pack` remaps IDs and creates links on import. New agents inherit the full knowledge graph, not just orphaned entries.
- **Auto-link on capture** — `capture_knowledge` now auto-creates links for ALL captured entries (not just first) above 0.7 confidence threshold, max 3 per entry. Response includes `autoLinkedCount`.
- **`backfill_links` op** — One-time Zettelkasten backfill for existing vaults: processes orphan entries, generates links via FTS5 suggestions above configurable threshold. Supports dry-run preview and progress callbacks.
- **`getAllLinksForEntries()` on LinkManager** — Bulk query for links involving a set of entry IDs. Used by pack export.

### Breaking Changes

- `drain()` return type changed from `number` to `DrainResult` (`{ processed, reason?, errors? }`). Callers checking `if (drain() === 0)` must update to `if (result.processed === 0)`.
- `CogneeAddResult` now includes optional `error` and `code` fields.
- `CogneeSyncManager` constructor accepts optional 4th argument `SyncManagerConfig`.

### Types

- New: `DrainResult`, `DrainAllResult`, `DrainStopReason`, `AddErrorCode`, `SyncManagerConfig`, `IntelligenceBundleLink`

---

## v8.1.0 — 2026-03-19 — Architectural Consolidation & OSS Readiness

### Architectural Cleanup (Milestone: Contract Fragmentation Cleanup — 6/6 closed)

- **Single source of truth for tool names** — `ENGINE_MODULE_MANIFEST` in `module-manifest.ts` is now the canonical registry. All templates, docs, and scaffolds generate from it. Zero hardcoded tool names.
- **Contract drift CI** — `module-manifest-drift.test.ts` (5 assertions) ensures `ENGINE_MODULES` and `ENGINE_MODULE_MANIFEST` stay in sync. Runs in existing CI.
- **File-tree canonical** — Forge facade defaults to file-tree `create` op. Legacy scaffold moved to `create_legacy` with deprecation notice.
- **SQLite-first persistence** — Removed `PostgresPersistenceProvider` (310 lines dead code). SQLite is the only supported backend. `PersistenceProvider` interface preserved for future extensibility. Postgres roadmap tracked in #230.
- **Narrowed extension privileges** — Domain packs and plugins receive `PackRuntime` (vault + projects + session checks) instead of full `AgentRuntime` (26+ modules). Backwards compatible via deprecated second argument.
- **Consolidated extension model** — Two clear tiers: Domain Packs (npm) and Local Packs (directories). Plugin system (`soleri-plugin.json`) deprecated in favor of `soleri-pack.json`.

### Features

- **Cold start fix** — Scaffold now seeds `knowledge/` from starter packs (design, security, architecture) instead of empty bundles. New agents start with 15-45 entries. Session briefing shows "Welcome" section for new agents.
- **Hot reload for packs** — `pack_install` registers new MCP tools at runtime via `registerTool` callback. `sendToolListChanged()` notifies connected clients. No restart needed.
- **LLM provider abstraction** — Removed hardcoded `provider: 'openai'` from all 6 internal call sites. All LLM calls route through `ModelRouter`. Users configure provider preference via `~/.{agentId}/model-routing.json`.
- **Version compatibility contract** — Vault format versioned via `PRAGMA user_version`. Engine rejects newer formats. Domain pack peer deps fixed to `^8.0.0`. `ENGINE_MAJOR_VERSION` constant for runtime checks.

### Testing & Quality

- **Curator full worker** — All 14 pipeline handlers tested (was 5). Full 8-step Salvador DAG pipeline E2E test: quality-gate → enrich → normalize → dedup → contradiction → cognee → link → verify.
- **Dead code audit** — Removed `doctor-checks.ts`, 5 unused functions, 4 dead re-exports. -167 lines via knip analysis.

### Documentation

- **CONTRIBUTING.md** rewritten with per-type review guidelines, testing requirements, brain/probabilistic testing guide.
- **extension-tiers.md** — Two-tier extension model (Domain Packs + Local Packs).
- **cross-platform.md** — Transport layers, IDE support matrix, host-specific vs agnostic.
- **multi-persona.md** — Design doc for cross-domain sessions (draft).
- **version-compatibility.md** — Semver contract, breaking change definitions, compatibility matrix.
- **Persistence section** added to README documenting SQLite-first choice.

## v8.0.0 — 2026-03-18 — Second Brain & Salvador Parity

### Second Brain (Milestone #39 — 8 features)

- **Two-pass vault retrieval** — `search` with `mode: "scan"` returns lightweight results (title + score + snippet), `load_entries` fetches full content. Saves 60-80% context tokens.
- **Proactive session briefing** — `session_briefing` op gathers last session, active plans, recent captures, brain recommendations, and curator health on session start.
- **Evidence-based reconciliation** — `plan_reconcile_with_evidence` cross-references plan tasks against git diff. Reports DONE/PARTIAL/MISSING per task, detects unplanned changes.
- **Routing feedback loop** — `routing_feedback` and `routing_accuracy` ops track whether intent classification was correct, with confidence calibration per bucket.
- **Ambient learning radar** — 6 ops (`radar_analyze/candidates/approve/dismiss/flush/stats`). Detects learning moments from corrections, search misses, workarounds. Auto-captures high-confidence patterns silently.
- **External knowledge ingestion** — `ingest_url` (fetch + classify), `ingest_text` (transcripts/notes), `ingest_batch` (multiple items). LLM-powered classification with dedup.
- **Content synthesis** — `synthesize` op turns vault knowledge into briefs, outlines, talking points, or post drafts. 4 output formats, audience targeting, source attribution, gap detection.
- **Composable skill chains** — `chain_execute/status/resume/list/step_approve`. Multi-step workflows with $variable data flow between steps, user-approval/auto-test/vault-check gates, SQLite persistence for pause/resume.

### Salvador Parity (Milestone #40 — 10 features)

- **Curator async infrastructure** — Generic `TypedEventBus`, `JobQueue` (SQLite, DAG deps, retries), `PipelineRunner` (background polling). 14 job handlers registered.
- **LLM quality gate** — 5-criteria scoring (novelty, actionability, specificity, relevance, informationDensity) with ACCEPT/REJECT verdict.
- **LLM classifier** — Auto-categorize vault entries by domain, severity, and tags.
- **Agency proactive intelligence** — Rule-based suggestion engine, rich clarifier (urgency levels, typed options with implications), warning suppression, pattern dismissal (24h TTL), notification queue. 7 new ops. 6 built-in suggestion rules.
- **Context engine scoring** — Multi-signal knowledge scoring (baseScore + titleMatch + tagOverlap + intentBoost). Tunable weights. Entity span tracking.
- **Enriched session capture** — 5 new fields: intent, decisions, currentState, nextSteps, vaultEntriesReferenced. Backward compatible.
- **Plan purge** — Permanently delete archived/completed/stale/specific plans with dry-run preview.
- **Memory knowledge governance** — 10 new ops: memory_get, session_search, knowledge_audit, smart_capture, knowledge_health, merge_patterns, knowledge_reorganize, list_project_knowledge, list_projects, knowledge_debug.
- **Doctor health checks** — 8 specialized checks: config, database, vault, LLM, auth, plugins, embeddings, security.
- **LLM model routing** — Default task-to-model routes (Haiku for routine, Sonnet for reasoning). Anthropic extended thinking routes. Configurable per agent.

### Infrastructure

- **Claude Code OAuth discovery** — Cross-platform (macOS Keychain + Linux GNOME Keyring + credentials file). Free Anthropic API via Claude Code subscription. Auto-integrated into key pool.
- **79 new tests** (1913 total). 14 new source files. ~50 new ops.

## v7.0.0 — 2026-03-16 — File-Tree Architecture

### Breaking Changes

- **Agents are folders, not TypeScript projects.** `soleri create` now generates a file-tree agent (agent.yaml + instructions/ + workflows/ + knowledge/) instead of a TypeScript project. Use `--legacy` for old behavior.
- **No build step required.** File-tree agents are ready to use immediately after scaffolding.
- **Old Salvador MCP retired.** The reference agent is now `agents/salvador-filetree/`.

### Added

- **`registerEngine()`** — Direct MCP tool registration replacing the facade factory. Grouped tools (`soleri_vault op:search`) with O(1) op lookup via Map instead of linear array scan.
- **Engine binary** (`soleri-engine`) — Standalone MCP server that reads `agent.yaml` and boots the knowledge engine. Entry point for all file-tree agents.
- **`AgentYamlSchema`** — Zod schema for `agent.yaml`, the single source of truth for agent identity and configuration.
- **`scaffoldFileTree()`** — Generates folder-tree agents in ~3 seconds (vs ~40s for TypeScript scaffolding).
- **`composeClaudeMd()`** — Auto-generates CLAUDE.md from agent.yaml + instructions/ + workflows/ + skills/. Never manually edited.
- **`createCoreOps()`** — Generates agent-specific ops (health, identity, activate, register, setup) from agent.yaml config at engine startup.
- **File-tree agent detection** — CLI commands (create, install, dev, list, doctor) detect and support both file-tree and legacy agents.
- **`soleri dev` for file-tree agents** — Starts the knowledge engine AND watches files for changes, auto-regenerating CLAUDE.md.
- **`soleri install` for file-tree agents** — Registers `@soleri/engine` (not `node dist/index.js`) in editor MCP configs.
- **Salvador file-tree agent** — Full port of Salvador to file-tree format: 23 skills, 6 workflows, 4 knowledge bundles, 477-line auto-generated CLAUDE.md.
- **Minimal example agent** — `examples/minimal-agent/` demonstrating the file-tree format.
- **Architecture spec** — `docs/architecture/file-tree-agent-format.md` defining the folder structure, agent.yaml schema, and CLAUDE.md composition algorithm.
- **E2E test for file-tree flow** — Full pipeline test: scaffold → boot engine → MCP connect → call ops → verify responses (10 tests).

### Architecture

The engine is now two cleanly separated layers:

1. **File Tree (shell)** — agent.yaml, instructions/, workflows/, knowledge/. The model reads these natively.
2. **Knowledge Engine (brain)** — vault, brain, curator, planner, memory. Persistent state and learning via `@soleri/core`.

### Migration

- Existing TypeScript agents continue to work with `--legacy` flag
- To convert: create `agent.yaml` from your persona.ts, move playbooks to `workflows/`, move intelligence data to `knowledge/`
- The knowledge engine is backward-compatible — same vault schema, same ops

---

## @soleri/core@2.11.0 — 2026-03-11

## @soleri/core@2.5.0 — 2026-03-07

### Added

- **Cognee Sync Manager** — Queue-based dirty tracking with SQLite `cognee_sync_queue` table. Auto-enqueues on vault seed/remove/bulkRemove. Drain logic processes batches of 10 with max 3 retries. Health-flip detection auto-drains when Cognee comes back online. Startup reconciliation re-queues stale `processing` entries.
- **Intake Pipeline** — 6-stage book/PDF ingestion: init → chunk → classify → dedup → store → finalize. SQLite `intake_jobs` + `intake_chunks` tables. Supports PDF (via optional `pdf-parse`) and plain text. LLM-powered content classification extracts patterns, anti-patterns, rules, and workflows.
- **Content Classifier** — Uses `LLMClient.complete()` with structured JSON extraction to classify text chunks into typed knowledge items with titles, descriptions, severity, and tags.
- **Dedup Gate** — TF-IDF cosine similarity (threshold 0.85) against existing vault entries to prevent near-duplicate ingestion.
- **7 new ops** (196 → 203 total): `cognee_sync_status`, `cognee_sync_drain`, `cognee_sync_reconcile`, `intake_ingest_book`, `intake_process`, `intake_status`, `intake_preview`
- **Temporal decay scoring** — Vault entries decay over time using configurable half-life. `decayedScore()` applies exponential decay to confidence scores based on entry age.
- **Bi-temporal fields** — Vault entries track both `validFrom`/`validTo` (business time) and `recordedAt`/`supersededAt` (system time). Point-in-time queries via `vault.getAsOf(timestamp)`.
- **Cognee × Curator hybrid** — Curator contradiction detection cross-references Cognee vector search results to surface semantic contradictions beyond keyword matching.
- **Execution metrics** — Per-task timing with `startedAt`/`completedAt` auto-set on status transitions. `ExecutionSummary` aggregates across plan tasks.
- **Task deliverables** — `submitDeliverable()` records file/vault_entry/url deliverables on plan tasks with SHA-256 hashing. `verifyDeliverables()` checks existence and hash staleness.
- **Loop anomaly detection** — `detectAnomaly()` flags fast + low-score iteration combos. Per-mode duration thresholds.
- **Admin hot reload** — `admin_hot_reload` op rebuilds brain vocabulary, vault FTS index, and template cache in one call.
- `pdf-parse` added as optional dependency for PDF ingestion

## @soleri/core@2.4.0 — 2026-03-06

### Added

- **84 new ops** across 6 modules (113 → 196 total, then +1 playbook_create = 197, then close parity gap to 185, then v6.1.0 to 191, then v6.2.0 to 196):
  - **Planning** — `plan_execution_metrics`, `plan_record_task_metrics`, `plan_submit_deliverable`, `plan_verify_deliverables`, plan grading with A–F letter grades
  - **Memory** — Cross-project search, promote to global, session capture

- **Errors module** — Structured error types with codes and metadata (`errors.ts`)
- **Persistence abstraction** — `PersistenceProvider` interface decouples vault from raw SQLite (`persistence/provider.ts`)
- **Prompt templates** — Compilable prompt templates with variable substitution (`templates/`)
- **30 ops closing Salvador feature parity gap** (#148–#160)

## @soleri/forge@5.4.0 — 2026-03-06

### Changed

- Core facade test template updated to match `@soleri/core@2.4.0` op count
- Scaffolder preview array synced with all new ops

## @soleri/core@2.3.0 — 2026-03-05

### Added

- **Structured logging** — `Logger` class with level-based filtering (debug/info/warn/error), JSON output mode, and context tags (#138)
- **Brain typed feedback** — `BrainFeedback` with explicit `positive`/`negative`/`neutral` types and extraction tracking (#123)
- **Auto-extraction on session end** — Brain automatically extracts knowledge when sessions complete
- **Source-aware recommendations** — Brain recommendations include provenance (vault, brain, session)

- **Hook system for generated agents** — Scaffolded agents include Claude Code hooks for quality gates (#137)
- Scaffolder op sync updated to match core 2.3.0

### Changed

- Domain-facade template marked as v4 legacy (v5.0+ agents use runtime factories)

## @soleri/cli@1.3.0 — 2026-03-05

### Added

- **Hook pack system** — Installable quality gates via `soleri hooks add-pack/remove-pack/list-packs/upgrade-pack`. Ships 5 built-in packs: `typescript-safety`, `a11y`, `css-discipline`, `clean-commits`, and `full` (composed from the other 4)
- **Create wizard integration** — Multiselect prompt during `soleri create` lets users pick hook packs at scaffolding time
- **`--project` flag** — `add-pack --project` / `remove-pack --project` installs hookify files to project `.claude/` instead of global `~/.claude/`, enabling team-shared quality gates
- **`upgrade-pack` command** — Force-overwrites installed hooks with latest pack version
- **Custom/local packs** — `.soleri/hook-packs/<name>/` directories with `manifest.json` are discovered alongside built-in packs; local packs override built-in packs with the same name
- **Pack versioning** — All manifests include `version` field; hookify files embed `# Version:` headers for staleness detection
- **`hookPacks` in config file** — `"hookPacks": ["typescript-safety"]` in JSON config for non-interactive `--config` mode
- **Doctor hook pack check** — `soleri doctor` now reports hook pack installation status

## @soleri/forge@5.2.0 — 2026-03-05

### Added

- **`hookPacks` field in `AgentConfigSchema`** — Optional `string[]` field for specifying hook packs in config files

## @soleri/forge@5.1.3 — 2026-03-05

### Added

- **CLAUDE.md cleanup on deactivation** — `deactivateAgent()` now calls `removeClaudeMdGlobal()` to strip the agent's section from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, preventing stale test agent instructions from accumulating
- New exports in generated `inject-claude-md.ts`: `removeClaudeMdGlobal()`, `removeClaudeMd(projectPath)`

## @soleri/cli@1.0.4 — 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Tool name discrepancy — hook templates now use `{agentId}_core` (preserving hyphens) instead of converting to underscores, matching actual MCP tool registration

## @soleri/forge@5.1.2 — 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Tool name discrepancy in CLAUDE.md template, activate template, setup script, and patching — all now preserve hyphens in agentId to match MCP tool registration (`my-agent_core` not `my_agent_core`)

## @soleri/cli@1.0.3 — 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Version bump to republish — 1.0.2 was published before auto-routing hook changes landed

## @soleri/cli@1.0.2 — 2026-03-05

### Added

- **Auto-routing UserPromptSubmit hook** — Generated Claude Code settings now include a bash hook that keyword-matches every user prompt and outputs a visible `[MODE]` indicator (FIX-MODE, BUILD-MODE, IMPROVE-MODE, etc.), then instructs the LLM to call `route_intent` for full behavior rules
- **SessionStart hook** — Reminds the LLM to register the project and check for active plans on session start

## @soleri/forge@5.1.1 — 2026-03-05

### Added

- **Auto-Routing section in generated CLAUDE.md** — Tells the LLM how to respond when `[MODE-NAME]` indicators appear in system context, including calling `route_intent` and following behavior rules
- **Control ops in facade table** — 8 new ops documented: `route_intent`, `morph`, `get_behavior_rules`, `get_identity`, `update_identity`, `add_guideline`, `remove_guideline`, `rollback_identity`

## @soleri/forge@5.1.0 — 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Updated `identity` op in entry-point template to delegate to `IdentityManager` with PERSONA fallback
- Updated `activate` op to seed identity from PERSONA on first activation
- Updated test template op count 42 → 50 to match `@soleri/core@2.2.0` control ops

## @soleri/core@2.2.0 — 2026-03-05

### Added

- **`IdentityManager` class** — Agent identity CRUD with versioning and rollback (`control/identity-manager.ts`)
- **`IntentRouter` class** — Keyword-based intent classification and operational mode management (`control/intent-router.ts`)
- **Control types** extracted to `control/types.ts` — identity, guideline, intent, and mode types
- **8 new control ops** in `createCoreOps()` (37 → 45 total):
  - `get_identity` — Get current agent identity with guidelines
  - `update_identity` — Update identity fields with auto-versioning
  - `add_guideline` — Add behavioral guideline (behavior/preference/restriction/style)
  - `remove_guideline` — Remove a guideline by ID
  - `rollback_identity` — Restore a previous identity version
  - `route_intent` — Classify prompt into intent + mode via keyword matching
  - `morph` — Switch operational mode manually
  - `get_behavior_rules` — Get behavior rules for current or specified mode
- **5 new SQLite tables**: `agent_identity`, `agent_identity_versions`, `agent_guidelines`, `agent_modes`, `agent_routing_log`
- **10 default operational modes** seeded on first use (BUILD, FIX, VALIDATE, DESIGN, IMPROVE, DELIVER, EXPLORE, PLAN, REVIEW, GENERAL)

## @soleri/forge@5.0.1 — 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Updated test template op count 31 → 42 to match `@soleri/core@2.1.0` brain intelligence ops

## @soleri/core@2.1.0 — 2026-03-05

### Added

- **`BrainIntelligence` class** — Pattern strength scoring, session knowledge extraction, and cross-domain intelligence pipeline (`brain/intelligence.ts`)
- **Brain types extracted** to `brain/types.ts` — all existing + 13 new intelligence types. Re-exported from `brain.ts` for backward compat
- **11 new brain ops** in `createCoreOps()` (26 → 37 total):
  - `brain_session_context` — Recent sessions, tool/file frequency
  - `brain_strengths` — 4-signal pattern scoring (usage + spread + success + recency, each 0-25)
  - `brain_global_patterns` — Cross-domain pattern registry
  - `brain_recommend` — Context-aware pattern recommendations
  - `brain_build_intelligence` — Full pipeline: strengths → registry → profiles
  - `brain_export` / `brain_import` — Brain data portability
  - `brain_extract_knowledge` — 6-rule heuristic extraction from sessions
  - `brain_archive_sessions` — Prune old sessions
  - `brain_promote_proposals` — Promote extracted knowledge to vault entries
  - `brain_lifecycle` — Start/end brain sessions
- **5 new SQLite tables**: `brain_strengths`, `brain_sessions`, `brain_proposals`, `brain_global_registry`, `brain_domain_profiles`
- `brainIntelligence` field on `AgentRuntime` interface
- 50+ new test cases in `brain-intelligence.test.ts`

## @soleri/core@2.0.0 — 2026-03-05

### Breaking Changes

- **Runtime Factory** — `createAgentRuntime(config)` replaces manual module initialization. Single call wires Vault, Brain, Planner, Curator, KeyPool, and LLMClient
- **LLMClient moved to core** — `LLMClient` and `ModelRouter` now live in `@soleri/core` (was a generated template in forge). Constructor: `LLMClient(openaiKeyPool, anthropicKeyPool, agentId?)`
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk` added as optional peer dependency (dynamic import at runtime)

### Added

- **`createAgentRuntime(config)`** — Factory that initializes all agent modules with sensible defaults (`runtime/runtime.ts`)
- **`createCoreOps(runtime)`** — Returns 26 generic `OpDefinition[]` covering search, vault, memory, export, planning, brain, and curator ops (`runtime/core-ops.ts`)
- **`createDomainFacade(runtime, agentId, domain)`** — Creates a standard 5-op domain facade at runtime (get_patterns, search, get_entry, capture, remove) (`runtime/domain-ops.ts`)
- **`createDomainFacades(runtime, agentId, domains)`** — Batch factory for multiple domain facades
- **`AgentRuntimeConfig` / `AgentRuntime` types** — Interfaces for the factory pattern (`runtime/types.ts`)
- **`LLMClient`** — Full LLM client with circuit breaker, retry, key rotation, model routing, dynamic Anthropic SDK import (`llm/llm-client.ts`)
- 33 new tests (runtime, core-ops, domain-ops, llm-client), 0 regressions in existing 201 tests

## @soleri/forge@5.0.0 — 2026-03-05

### Breaking Changes

- Generated agents now use `createAgentRuntime()`, `createCoreOps()`, `createDomainFacades()` from `@soleri/core` instead of inlined boilerplate
- Generated `package.json` depends on `@soleri/core: ^2.0.0` (was `^1.0.0`)
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk` moved to `optionalDependencies` (was `dependencies`)
- No more `src/facades/` or `src/llm/` directories generated — facades created at runtime

### Removed

- **`core-facade.ts` template** — Replaced by `createCoreOps()` from core (26 generic ops + 5 agent-specific ops in entry point)
- **`llm-client.ts` template** — `LLMClient` now lives in `@soleri/core`
- Per-domain facade file generation — `createDomainFacades()` handles this at runtime

### Changed

- Entry point template shrunk from ~100 to ~60 lines (thin shell calling core factories)
- Only 5 agent-specific ops remain in generated code: `health`, `identity`, `activate`, `inject_claude_md`, `setup`
- `domain-manager.ts` detects v5.0 agents and skips facade file generation
- `knowledge-installer.ts` detects v5.0 agents and skips facade file generation
- `patching.ts` supports both v5.0 (array literal in `createDomainFacades()`) and v4.x (import anchors) formats
- Test template uses runtime factories instead of manual module initialization
- Scaffolded agents get new core features (e.g., Curator) via `npm update @soleri/core` — zero re-scaffolding

## @soleri/core@1.1.0 — 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Curator** — Vault self-maintenance module: duplicate detection (TF-IDF cosine similarity), contradiction scanning (pattern vs anti-pattern), tag normalization with alias registry, entry grooming, consolidation (archive stale, remove duplicates), changelog audit trail, health audit (0-100 score with coverage/freshness/quality/tag metrics)
- **Text utilities** — Extracted shared TF-IDF functions (`tokenize`, `calculateTf`, `calculateTfIdf`, `cosineSimilarity`) to `text/similarity.ts` for reuse across Brain and Curator
- 39 new Curator tests, 0 regressions in existing 162 tests

### Changed

- Brain module now imports TF-IDF utilities from `text/similarity.ts` instead of inlining them

## @soleri/forge@4.2.0 — 2026-03-04

### Added

- **8 curator ops** in generated core facade: `curator_status`, `curator_detect_duplicates`, `curator_contradictions`, `curator_resolve_contradiction`, `curator_groom`, `curator_groom_all`, `curator_consolidate`, `curator_health_audit`
- 7 curator facade tests in generated test template
- Curator initialization in generated entry point (after Brain, before LLM)

### Changed

- `createCoreFacade()` signature: added optional `curator` parameter (backwards compatible — all ops gracefully return error if curator not provided)

## @soleri/forge@4.2.2 — 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Cognee operation tests in generated agents** — scaffolded test suites now cover `cognee_status`, `cognee_sync`, and `graph_search` ops, verifying graceful degradation when Cognee is unavailable

## @soleri/core@2.0.1 — 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- **Cognee hybrid search cross-referencing** — Vector scores were always 0.000 because Cognee assigns its own UUIDs to chunks and strips embedded metadata during chunking. Replaced naive ID mapping with 4-tier matching: `[vault-id:]` prefix extraction, title first-line match, title substring match, and FTS5 fallback.
- Strategy 4 (FTS5 fallback) now preserves caller filters (domain/type/severity) to avoid reintroducing excluded entries
- Title-to-ID mapping handles duplicate titles correctly via `Map<string, string[]>`

## @soleri/forge@4.2.1 — 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- **Generated test template parameter shift** — `createCoreFacade()` calls in scaffolded agent tests were missing the `cognee` parameter (4th position), causing `llmClient` to land in the wrong slot and `llm_status` tests to fail with `isAvailable is not a function`
- Extracted `makeCoreFacade()` helper in generated tests to prevent future signature drift

## create-soleri@1.0.0 — 2026-03-04

### Added

- **`npm create soleri my-agent`** — Standard npm create shorthand for scaffolding agents
- Thin wrapper that delegates to `@soleri/cli` — no extra dependencies or configuration
- Supports all `@soleri/cli create` flags via pass-through args

## @soleri/core@2.0.0 — 2026-03-04

### Breaking Changes

- **`Brain.intelligentSearch()` is now async** — returns `Promise<RankedResult[]>` instead of `RankedResult[]`. All facade handlers already await results, so callers using the generated core facade are unaffected.
- **`Brain.getRelevantPatterns()` is now async** — same change, same safe migration.
- `ScoringWeights` and `ScoreBreakdown` now include a `vector` field (defaults to `0` without Cognee).

### Added

- **Cognee integration** — Optional hybrid search combining SQLite FTS5 with Cognee vector embeddings + knowledge graph
  - `CogneeClient` — HTTP client modeled after Salvador MCP's battle-tested Cognee integration
  - Auto-register/login auth with service account (no manual token setup required)
  - `CHUNKS` search type default (reliable with small local models unlike `GRAPH_COMPLETION`)
  - 120s search timeout (handles Ollama cold start), 5s health check, 30s general
  - Debounced cognify with 30s sliding window (coalesces rapid ingests)
  - Position-based scoring fallback when Cognee omits numeric scores
  - `CogneeConfig`, `CogneeSearchResult`, `CogneeStatus` types
  - Zero new npm dependencies (uses built-in `fetch`)
- **Hybrid scoring** — When Cognee is available, search uses 6-dimension scoring (semantic TF-IDF 0.25, vector 0.35, severity 0.1, recency 0.1, tag overlap 0.1, domain match 0.1). Without Cognee, original 5-dimension weights preserved.
- **`Brain.syncToCognee()`** — Bulk sync all vault entries to Cognee and trigger knowledge graph build
- **Fire-and-forget Cognee sync** on `enrichAndCapture()` — new entries automatically sent to Cognee when available
- Docker Compose config for self-hosted Cognee stack (`docker/docker-compose.cognee.yml`)

## @soleri/cli@1.0.1 — 2026-03-04

### Added

- **`checkCognee()`** in `soleri doctor` — Checks Cognee availability at localhost:8000, returns `warn` (not `fail`) if down

## @soleri/forge@4.2.0 (Cognee) — 2026-03-04

### Added

- Cognee initialization in generated entry points (mirrors LLM client pattern) with env var overrides (`COGNEE_URL`, `COGNEE_API_TOKEN`, `COGNEE_EMAIL`, `COGNEE_PASSWORD`)
- Background vault-to-Cognee sync on agent startup when Cognee is available
- 3 new core facade operations: `cognee_status`, `cognee_sync`, `graph_search`
- `graph_search` defaults to `CHUNKS` search type (configurable via `searchType` param)

### Changed

- `createCoreFacade()` signature now accepts optional `CogneeClient` parameter
- `search` op handler now awaits `brain.intelligentSearch()` (async)

## @soleri/cli@1.0.0 — 2026-03-04

Initial release of the developer CLI.

### Added

- **`soleri create [name]`** — Interactive wizard using @clack/prompts to scaffold new agents. Supports `--config <path>` for non-interactive mode
- **`soleri list [dir]`** — Formatted table of agents in a directory with ID, domains, build status, and dependency status
- **`soleri add-domain <domain>`** — Add a new knowledge domain to an existing agent (creates bundle, generates facade, patches index.ts + claude-md-content.ts, rebuilds)
- **`soleri install-knowledge <pack>`** — Install knowledge packs from a local path into the agent in the current directory
- **`soleri dev`** — Run the agent in development mode via `npx tsx src/index.ts` with inherited stdio
- **`soleri doctor`** — Health check: Node.js version, npm, tsx, agent project detection, dependencies, build status, MCP registration
- **`soleri hooks add <editor>`** — Generate editor-specific hooks/config for claude-code, cursor, windsurf, or copilot
- **`soleri hooks remove <editor>`** — Remove editor hooks/config files
- **`soleri hooks list`** — Show which editor hooks are currently installed
- Input sanitization for agent IDs in shell hook commands
- Error handling with try/catch wrappers around forge API calls
- 51 tests across 7 test files

## @soleri/forge@4.1.0 — 2026-03-04

### Added

- **`addDomain()` function** — Programmatic API to add a knowledge domain to an existing agent (new `domain-manager.ts`)
- **`add_domain` forge operation** — MCP-accessible op wrapping `addDomain()` for AI-side parity
- **`./lib` export path** — `import { scaffold, addDomain, ... } from '@soleri/forge/lib'` for programmatic access without starting the MCP server
- **`patching.ts`** — Extracted `patchIndexTs()` and `patchClaudeMdContent()` from knowledge-installer for reuse

### Changed

- `addDomain` reports failure when source file patching fails (not just build failures)
- Malformed `package.json` in agent projects returns a structured error instead of throwing

## @soleri/core@1.0.0 — 2026-03-04

Initial release of the shared engine package.

### Added

- **Vault** — SQLite + FTS5 full-text search with BM25 ranking, domain-separated knowledge store, project registration, memory system
- **Brain** — TF-IDF 5-dimension scoring (semantic, severity, recency, tag overlap, domain match), auto-tagging, duplicate detection, adaptive weights via feedback
- **Planner** — JSON-file state machine (draft → approved → executing → completed) with task tracking
- **LLM utilities** — `SecretString`, `LLMError`, `CircuitBreaker` (closed/open/half-open), `retry()` with exponential backoff + jitter, `parseRateLimitHeaders()`
- **KeyPool** — Multi-key rotation with per-key circuit breakers, preemptive quota rotation, `loadKeyPoolConfig(agentId)` for agent-specific key paths
- **Facade system** — `OpHandler`, `FacadeConfig`, `registerFacade()`, `registerAllFacades()` for MCP tool registration
- **Intelligence loader** — `loadIntelligenceData()` with bundle validation and graceful error handling
- 162 tests covering all modules

## @soleri/forge@4.0.0 — 2026-03-04

### Breaking Changes

- Generated agents now depend on `@soleri/core` instead of carrying inlined copies of vault, brain, planner, LLM, and facade infrastructure
- Generated `package.json` includes `@soleri/core: ^1.0.0` and removes direct `better-sqlite3` dependency
- `loadKeyPoolConfig()` in generated entry points now requires `agentId` parameter

### Changed

- Scaffolder generates ~15 config-driven files instead of ~30 (10 static modules + 5 test files removed)
- Templates updated to `import { Vault, Brain, Planner, ... } from '@soleri/core'` instead of local paths
- Removed directory creation for `src/vault/`, `src/brain/`, `src/planning/` (now in core)
- Test suite reduced from 6 generated test files to 1 (`facades.test.ts`); static module tests live in `@soleri/core`

### Migration

- **Existing v3.x agents are unaffected** — they keep their local copies and have no dependency on `@soleri/core`
- New agents scaffolded with v4.0 require `npm install` to pull `@soleri/core`
- To upgrade a v3.x agent manually: replace local `src/vault/`, `src/brain/`, `src/planning/`, `src/llm/{types,utils,key-pool}.ts`, `src/facades/{types,facade-factory}.ts`, `src/intelligence/{types,loader}.ts` with imports from `@soleri/core`

## @soleri/forge@3.0.0

Previous release — standalone agents with all code inlined. See [git history](https://github.com/adrozdenko/soleri/commits/main) for details.
